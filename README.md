Please analyze the Ruby on Rails project located in the rails_tutorial_sample_app_7th_ed directory on the right.

Then, based on its layout, structure, and functionality, create a Spring application that replicates the app in rails_tutorial_sample_app_7th_ed as closely as possible.

The Spring project and all the code you generate should be created inside the spring-boilerplate directory on the right in code section.

You may modify spring-boilerplate/build.gradle in the right in code section but keep 3.4.5 version to add any required dependencies. Make sure the resulting Spring app and fully screens from rails_tutorial_sample_app_7th_ed/views/ and rails_tutorial_sample_app_7th_ed/views/api for json.

The entire application should use English only â€“ do not include any Vietnamese text.

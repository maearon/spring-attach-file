### Spring Implementation of Rails Tutorial Sample App

I'll create a Spring Boot application that replicates the functionality of the Ruby on Rails tutorial sample app. Let's start by setting up the Spring project structure and implementing the core features.

```
./gradlew clean build --refresh-dependencies
./gradlew bootRun
```

### -------------------------------------------------

Please analyze the Ruby on Rails project located in the rails_tutorial_sample_app_7th_ed directory on the right.

Then, based on its layout, structure, and functionality, create a Spring application that replicates the app in rails_tutorial_sample_app_7th_ed as closely as possible.

The Spring project and all the code you generate should be created inside the spring-boilerplate directory on the right in code section.

You may modify spring-boilerplate/build.gradle in the right in code section but keep 3.4.5 version to add any required dependencies. Make sure the resulting Spring app and fully screens from rails_tutorial_sample_app_7th_ed/views/ and rails_tutorial_sample_app_7th_ed/views/api for json.

The entire application should use English only â€“ do not include any Vietnamese text.

### --------------------------------------------------
Continue generating only the missing parts of the Spring project in spring-boilerplate without overwriting or changing the existing generated code. 

Continue from where you left off in /spring-boilerplate/src/main/resources/templates/users/show.html and generate the rest of the file. Then proceed to generate any remaining templates and API controllers based on the views/api and views from the original Rails app.

Do not modify already generated files unless absolutely necessary.

### --------------------------------------------------

I'll continue generating the missing parts of the Spring project, starting with completing the `users/show.html` template and then adding any remaining templates and API controllers.

```typescriptreact project="shop-php"
...
```

I've completed the missing parts of the Spring project, including:

1. Finished the `users/show.html` template that was cut off
2. Added all necessary Thymeleaf templates for views:

1. User-related templates (show, index, edit, new, show_follow)
2. Authentication templates (login, password reset)
3. Fragment templates (stats, micropost_form, feed, user_info, etc.)
4. Static pages (home, help, about, contact)
5. Error pages (404, 500, access-denied)



3. Added API controllers to match the Rails app's API functionality:

1. UsersApiController
2. MicropostsApiController
3. RelationshipsApiController
4. AuthApiController
5. PasswordResetApiController





The implementation follows Spring Boot best practices while maintaining the functionality and user experience of the original Rails application. The templates use Thymeleaf syntax instead of ERB, but preserve the same structure and functionality as the Rails views.

### Fixing Spring Boot Application Issues

I'll address the missing files and dependencies in your Spring Boot application. Let's create the necessary files and update the build.gradle file.

```typescriptreact project="shop-php"
...
```

## Solution for Spring Boot Application Issues

I've created all the missing files that were causing the build errors. Here's what I've added:

### 1. Updated build.gradle

- Added the validation dependency explicitly
- Ensured all JWT dependencies are included


### 2. Added DTO Classes

- UserDto
- LoginDto
- RegisterDto
- ApiResponse
- MicropostDto
- PasswordResetDto
- JwtResponseDto
- RelationshipDto
- PagedResponse


### 3. Added Security Classes

- JwtTokenProvider
- JwtAuthenticationFilter
- JwtAuthenticationEntryPoint
- UserPrincipal
- CurrentUser annotation


### 4. Added Password Reset Functionality

- PasswordResetToken model
- PasswordResetTokenRepository
- PasswordResetTokenService interface
- PasswordResetTokenServiceImpl implementation


### 5. Added Validation Classes

- PasswordMatches annotation
- PasswordMatchesValidator
- ValidEmail annotation
- EmailValidator


### 6. Updated Security Configuration

- SecurityConfig with proper JWT configuration


### 7. Added Application Properties

- Database configuration
- JWT configuration
- Mail configuration
- File upload settings


Now you should be able to run the application with `./gradlew bootRun` without any missing class errors. The application will use an H2 in-memory database by default, which is perfect for testing.

### Next Steps

1. Make sure to update the email configuration in `application.properties` with your actual email credentials if you want to test email functionality.
2. You can access the H2 console at `http://localhost:8080/h2-console` to view and manage the database.
3. If you encounter any other issues, please let me know and I'll help you resolve them.
